# Book Cinema Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Component-Based Architecture
Every feature should be built as a collection of reusable components. Components must be self-contained, independently testable, and have a clear purpose.

### II. State Management
A centralized state management solution (e.g., Redux, MobX) MUST be used to manage the application state. This ensures a single source of truth and predictable state mutations.

### III. Cross-Platform Compatibility
All UI components and features MUST be tested on both iOS and Android to ensure a consistent user experience. Platform-specific code should be minimized and isolated.

## Development Workflow

The development process will follow a streamlined approach:
1.  **Specification:** Define feature requirements and user stories.
2.  **Implementation:** Develop the feature, adhering to the constitution.
3.  **Review:** Conduct a peer review of the code.
4.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the feature.

## Quality Assurance

-   **Unit Testing:** All components and functions MUST have unit tests.
-   **Integration Testing:** End-to-end tests SHOULD be written for critical user flows.
-   **Manual Testing:** A manual testing pass MUST be performed before each release.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for all development practices. Any amendments require a pull request and approval from the project maintainers.
